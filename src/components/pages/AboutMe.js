        <h3>hi there!</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Alyssa. I started my journey in web development at the
          University of Pennsylvania's intensive Coding Bootcamp in
          Philadelphia, PA. I have experience in HTML5, Javascript, Node.js,
          Express.js, React.js and MongoDB/MySQL database. I am always eager to
          find new ways to master my coding skills while keeping up with the
          latest technologies.
          <br />
          <br />
          Prior to web development, I graduated from Philadelphia University
          with a Bachelor of Science in Fashion Merchandising as well as ten
          years of experience in the fields of operations, management, and
          sales. I am hoping to continue to utilize skills learned in my
          previous industry to embark on this new journey in coding and web
          development.
